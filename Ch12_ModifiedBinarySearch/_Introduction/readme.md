# Introduction

whenever we are given a sorted **Array** or **LinkedList** or **Matrix**, and we are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm we can use is the [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).

This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving Binary Search. We will go through a set of problems that will help us build an understanding of this pattern
