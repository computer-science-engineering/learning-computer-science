# Behavioral Question Set 4

## Tell me a bit about your professional experience in 2-3 minutes

* This question will allow you to get an initial sense of your peer’s technical experience.
* Feel free to ask follow-up questions, for instance, can you elaborate a bit more on your experience with [specific technology] or your responsibilities at [company]? You can also use this opportunity to ask the candidate which of their experiences had the greatest impact on them.

## What are you looking for in your next role

* This is an opportunity to get insight into whether a candidate would be a good culture fit for your company. Is the candidate looking for a company of your size? Do their expectations match the role?

## What’s an example of a difficult technical problem you solved? Be specific about how the problem was diagnosed and your process for approaching it

* Owner vs participant: Many candidates will claim they led a big project or created significant impact, but if you dig deeper, you’ll find that the candidate only played a participatory role or was involved in just one facet of the project. As an interviewer, it’s your role to uncover the truth. Follow-up questions asking about who was involved, what the candidate personally did, and how they did it will help you make an informed decision about the candidate’s true impact.
* Good vs great achievements: Many candidates are good at quantifying their achievements, but you’ll want to know how big of an impact this achievement actually had. Was it a minor success or did it have a significant impact? Were the results due to the candidate’s impact, or would those results have likely occurred without their involvement? You may consider asking follow-up questions here too: try to drill down into the baseline metrics used, such as “What were the projected metrics had you not made this decision?”

## Speak about a project you’re most passionate about or one that you felt exhibited your best work

* Asking questions about a candidate’s successes can help empower them to get out of their shell.
* Apart from the actual experience, this question will also help you learn about a cool side project they’re working on and/or what kind of projects the candidate enjoys working on at your company.

## What was the most challenging bug you fixed in the last six months

* This question allows you to assess a candidate’s problem-solving skills, perseverance, and resourcefulness.
* Try to get a sense of the nature of the technical problem, the tactics they employed to solve it, and how it was eventually resolved.

## Can you tell me about your team’s engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)? What do you like and not like about it

* This question gets at the candidate and their team’s process. Learning how they approach problems can be helpful in determining whether they’d be a good fit at your company.
