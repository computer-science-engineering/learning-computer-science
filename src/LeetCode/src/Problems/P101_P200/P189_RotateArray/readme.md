# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Note:**

* Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
* Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
