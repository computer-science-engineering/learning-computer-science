# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find whether it's possible to divide this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
Output: True
Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
```

**Note:**

* `1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16`.
* `0 < nums[i] < 10000`.
