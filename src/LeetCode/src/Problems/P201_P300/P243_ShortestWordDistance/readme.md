# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a list of words and two words *word1* and *word2*, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

```plaintext
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
```

```plaintext
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

**Note:** You may assume that *word1* **does not equal** to *word2*, and *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.
