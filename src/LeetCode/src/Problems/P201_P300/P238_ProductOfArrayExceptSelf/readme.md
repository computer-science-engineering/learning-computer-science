# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array `nums` of *n* integers where *n > 1*,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O(n).

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
