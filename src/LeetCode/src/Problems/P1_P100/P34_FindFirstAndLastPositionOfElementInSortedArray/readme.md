# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log *n*).

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```
