# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an integer array *nums*, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```
