# Trees

Tree is slightly more complex than linked list, because the latter is a linear data structure while the former is not. Tree problems can be solved either breadth-first or depth-first. We have one problem here which is great for practicing breadth-first traversal.

We recommend: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, Validate Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree Level Order Traversal and Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree.
