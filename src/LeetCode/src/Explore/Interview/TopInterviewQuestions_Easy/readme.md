## Introduction

This is LeetCode's official curated list of Top classic interview questions to help you land your dream job. Our top interview questions are divided into the following series:

1. [Easy Collection](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/)
2. [Medium Collection](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-medium/)
3. [Hard Collection](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-hard/)

to help you master Data Structure & Algorithms and improve your coding skills.

Just like any other skills, coding interview is one area where you can greatly improve with [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice).

Most of the classic interview questions have multiple solution approaches. For the best practice result, we strongly advise you to go through this list at least a second time, or even better - a _third time_.

By the second attempt, you may discover some new tricks or new methods. By the third time, you should find that your code appear to be more concise compared to your first attempt. If so, congratulations!

**Remember:** Deliberate practice does not mean looking for answers and memorizing it. You won't go very far with that approach. The more you are able to solve a problem yourself without any reference to answers, the more you will improve.
