# Problem Definition

## Description

Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

**Note:**
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

**Follow up:**
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
