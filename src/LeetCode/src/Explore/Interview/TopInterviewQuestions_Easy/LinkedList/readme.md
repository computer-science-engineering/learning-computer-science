# Linked List

Linked List problems are relatively easy to master. Do not forget the Two-pointer technique, which not only applicable to Array problems but also Linked List problems as well.

Another technique to greatly simplify coding in linked list problems is the dummy node trick.

We recommend: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists and Linked List Cycle.

For additional challenge, solve these problems recursively: Reverse Linked List, Palindrome Linked List and Merge Two Sorted Lists.
