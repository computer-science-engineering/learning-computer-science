# Problem Definition

## Description

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example:**

Given nums1 = `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, nums2 = `[2, 2]`, return `[2, 2]`.

**Note:**

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays. The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**

* What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
* What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
* What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
