# Linked List

According to our survey data by users, Linked List problems are not asked frequently at Google. Perhaps most linked list problems are not that complex and is harder to ask follow up questions and complexity analysis is usually pretty straightforward.

Nonetheless, we strongly recommend you to still practice classic Linked List interview questions such as: [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/), [Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/) and [Copy List with Random Pointers](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/). These problems are really fun problems and they teach you how to think outside of the box.

Of course, [Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/) is one of our all-time favorite interview questions and Google seems to love this question as well. Make sure you understand how to analyze the time complexity! This is a must-asked follow up question for this problem.
