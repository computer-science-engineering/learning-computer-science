# Trees and Graphs

Tree is just a special case of graph. To understand the difference between trees and graphs, you can work on [Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/description/).

Graphs are generally search breath first or depth first. The same applies to Tree.

Graphs are generally more complex than trees. Similarly, trees are generally more complex than a linear data structure such as array or linked list.

Prepping for your knowledge in Graphs is essential for Google interviews as you would most likely encounter a tree or graph question. A great way to brush up is to implement a tree or graph by coding it from scratch in [Playground](https://leetcode.com/playground/).
