Interval related problems are quite often asked at Google interviews.

Similar to "Array and Strings", interval related problems can be asked in the context of [data stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm#Data_stream_model). Some good examples are: [My Calendar I](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/description/), [My Calendar II](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-ii/description/), [Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/), and [Sliding Window Median](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/description/).
