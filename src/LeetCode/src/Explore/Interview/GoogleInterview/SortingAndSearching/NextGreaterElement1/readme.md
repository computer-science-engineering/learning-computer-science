# Problem Definition

## Description

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums1`â€™s elements are subset of `nums2`. Find all the next greater numbers for `nums1`'s elements in the corresponding places of `nums2`.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in `nums1` is the first greater number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

**Note:**

1. All elements in `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
2. The length of both `nums1` and `nums2` would not exceed 1000.

## Notes

    Suppose we have a decreasing sequence followed by a greater number. For example `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6]` then the greater number `6` is the next greater element for all previous numbers in the sequence.

    We use a stack to keep a decreasing sub-sequence, whenever we see a number `x` greater than `stack.peek()` we pop all elements less than `x` and for all the popped ones, their next greater element is `x`.

    For example `[9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1, 6]`. The stack will first contain `[9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1]` and then we see `6` which is greater than `1` so we pop `1 2 3` whose next greater element should be `6`.
