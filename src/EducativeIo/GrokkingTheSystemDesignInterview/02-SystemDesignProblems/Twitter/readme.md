## What is Twitter

## Requirements and Goals of the System

### Functional Requirements

1. Users should be able to post new tweets.
2. A user should be able to follow other users.
3. Users should be able to mark tweets as favorites.
4. The service should be able to create and display a userâ€™s timeline consisting of top tweets from all the people the user follows.
5. Tweets can contain photos and videos.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Our service needs to be highly available.
2. Acceptable latency of the system is 200ms for timeline generation.
3. Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability); if a user doesn't see a tweet for a while, it should be fine.

### Extended Requirements

## Capacity Estimation and Constraints

- 1 B total users with 200 M DAU.
- 100 M new tweets every day.
- On average each user follows 200 people.
