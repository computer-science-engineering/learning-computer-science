# Course Overview

This course categorizes coding interview problems into a set of 15 patterns.

Overall, the course has around 150 problems mapped to 15 patterns.

The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques. We will make use of **Breadth First Search** and **Depth First Search** to solve problems related to **Trees** and **Graphs**. Similarly, we will also cover **Dynamic Programming**, **Backtracking**, **Recursion**, **Greedy algorithms**, and **Divide & Conquer**.

We will start with a brief introduction of each pattern before jumping onto the problems. The first problem, under each pattern, will explain the underlying pattern in detail to build the concepts that can be applied to later problems. The later problems will focus on the different constraints each problem presents and how our algorithm needs to change to handle them.
