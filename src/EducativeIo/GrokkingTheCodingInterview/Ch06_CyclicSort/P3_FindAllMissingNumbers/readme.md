# Problem Definition

## Description

We are given an unsorted array containing numbers taken from the range 1 to ‘n’. The array can have duplicates, which means some numbers will be missing. Find all those missing numbers.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [2, 3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 1]
Output: 4, 6, 7
Explanation: The array should have all numbers from 1 to 8, due to duplicates 4, 6, and 7 are missing.
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [2, 4, 1, 2]
Output: 3
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: [2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: 4
```

## Notes

This problem follows the **Cyclic Sort** pattern and shares similarities with **Find the Missing Number** with one difference. In this problem, there can be many duplicates whereas in ‘Find the Missing Number’ there were no duplicates and the range was greater than the length of the array.

However, we will follow a similar approach though as discussed in **Find the Missing Number** to place the numbers on their correct indices. Once we are done with the cyclic sort we will iterate the array to find all indices that are missing the correct numbers.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n) as we are iterating the input array only once. Since we are not incrementing the index while swapping, this will result in more than ‘n’ iterations of the loop. In the worst case scenario, the while loop will only swap a total of ‘n’ numbers as once a number is at its correct index, we will move on to the next number. So overall, our algorithm will take O(n) + O(n) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(n).

### Space Complexity

Ignoring the space required for the output array, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
