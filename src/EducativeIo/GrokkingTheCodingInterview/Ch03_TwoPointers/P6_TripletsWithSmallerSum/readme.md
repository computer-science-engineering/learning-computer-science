# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array `arr` of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target` where `i`, `j`, and `k` are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum is less than the target:
   [-1, 1, 4], [-1, 1, 3], [-1, 1, 2], [-1, 2, 3]
```
