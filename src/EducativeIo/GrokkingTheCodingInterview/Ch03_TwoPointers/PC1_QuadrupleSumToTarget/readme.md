# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array of unsorted numbers and a target number, find all **unique quadruplets** in it, whose **sum is equal to the target number**.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [4, 1, 2, -1, 1, -3], target=1
Output: [-3, -1, 1, 4], [-3, 1, 1, 2]
Explanation: Both the quadruplets add up to the target.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [2, 0, -1, 1, -2, 2], target=2
Output: [-2, 0, 2, 2], [-1, 0, 1, 2]
Explanation: Both the quadruplets add up to the target.
```

## Notes

This problem follows the **Two Pointers** pattern and shares similarities with **Triplet Sum to Zero**.

We can follow a similar approach to iterate through the array, taking one number at a time. At every step during the iteration, we will search for the quadruplets similar to **Triplet Sum to Zero** whose sum is equal to the given target.

### Time complexity

Sorting the array will take O(N*logN). Overall `searchQuadruplets()` will take O(N * logN + N^3), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^3).

### Space complexity

The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting.
