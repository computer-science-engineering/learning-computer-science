# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array with positive numbers and a target number, find all subarrays in it whose **product is less than the target number**.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [2, 5, 3, 10], target=30
Output: [2], [5], [2, 5], [3], [5, 3], [10]
Explanation: There are six subarrays whose product is less than the target.
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [8, 2, 6, 5], target=50
Output: [8], [2], [8, 2], [6], [2, 6], [5], [6, 5]
Explanation: There are seven subarrays whose product is less than the target.
```

## Notes

This problem follows the **Sliding Window** and the **Two Pointers** pattern and shares similarities with **Triplets with Smaller Sum** with two differences:

1. In this problem, the input array is not sorted.
2. Instead of finding triplets with sum less than a target, we need to find all subarrays having a product less than the target.

The implementation will be quite similar to **Triplets with Smaller Sum**.

### Time complexity

The main `for-loop` managing the sliding window takes O(N) but creating subarrays can take up to O(N^2) in the worst case. Therefore overall, our algorithm will take O(N^3).

### Space complexity

Ignoring the space required for the output list, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

How much space will be required for the output list?

At the most, we need a space of O(n^2) for all the output lists.
