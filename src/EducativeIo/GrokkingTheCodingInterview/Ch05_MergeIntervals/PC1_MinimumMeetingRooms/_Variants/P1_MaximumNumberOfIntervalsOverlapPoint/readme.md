# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a list of intervals, find the point where the maximum number of intervals overlap.

Example:

```plaintext
intervals: [[1, 4], [2, 5], [9, 12], [5, 9], [5, 12]]
First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4,
second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.

Output: 5
There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.
