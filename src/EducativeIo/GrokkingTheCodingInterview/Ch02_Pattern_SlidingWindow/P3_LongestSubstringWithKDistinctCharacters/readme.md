# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** in it **with no more than K distinct characters**.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: String="araaci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: String="araaci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".
```

## Notes

For Sliding Window algorithm:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of characters in the input string. The outer `for` loop runs for all characters and the inner `while` loop processes each character only once, therefore the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(K), as we will be storing a maximum of ‘K+1’ characters in the HashMap.
