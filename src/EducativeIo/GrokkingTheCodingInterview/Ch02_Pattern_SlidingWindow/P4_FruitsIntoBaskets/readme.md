# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given **two baskets** and your goal is to put **maximum number of fruits in each basket**. The only restriction is that **each basket can have only one type of fruit**.

You can start with any tree, but once you have started you can’t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
Output: 5
Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
```

## Notes

For Sliding Window algorithm:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of characters in the input string. The outer `for` loop runs for all characters and the inner `while` loop processes each character only once, therefore the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm runs in constant space O(1) as there can be a maximum of three types of fruits stored in the frequency map.

### Similar Problems

**Problem 1:** Longest Substring with at most 2 distinct characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with at most two distinct characters.

**Solution:** This problem is exactly similar to our parent problem.
