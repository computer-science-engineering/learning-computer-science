# Introduction

**0/1 Knapsack** pattern is based on the famous problem with the same name which is efficiently solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

In this pattern, we will go through a set of problems to develop an understanding of DP. We will always start with a brute-force recursive solution to see the overlapping sub-problems, i.e., realizing that we are solving the same problems repeatedly.

After the recursive solution, we will modify our algorithm to apply advanced techniques of **Memoization** and **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming** to develop a complete understanding of this pattern.
