# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a list of ‘K’ sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted list.

## Discussion

### Approach

This problem is similar to **Merge K Sorted Lists** except that the input is a list of arrays compared to LinkedLists. To handle this, we can use a similar approach as discussed in the problem **Kth Smallest Number in M Sorted Lists**. We will create a `Node` class which will track the array and the element indices.

#### Time Complexity

#### Space Complexity
