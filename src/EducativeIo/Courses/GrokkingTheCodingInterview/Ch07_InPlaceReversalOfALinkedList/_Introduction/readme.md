# Introduction

In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern describes an efficient way to solve the above problem. In the following chapters, we will solve a bunch of problems using this pattern.
