# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an unsorted array containing numbers, find the smallest missing positive number in it.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [-3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest missing positive number is '3'
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [3, -2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: 4
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: [3, 2, 5, 1]
Output: 4
```

## Notes

This problem follows the **Cyclic Sort** pattern and shares similarities with **Find the Missing Number** with one big difference. In this problem, the numbers are not bound by any range so we can have any number in the input array.

However, we will follow a similar approach though as discussed in **Find the Missing Number** to place the numbers on their correct indices and ignore all numbers that are out of the range of the array (i.e., all negative numbers and all numbers greater than or equal to the length of the array). Once we are done with the cyclic sort we will iterate the array and the first index that does not have the correct number will be the smallest missing positive number!

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n) as we are iterating the input array two times. Since we are not incrementing the index while swapping, this will result in more than ‘n’ iterations of the loop. In the worst case scenario, the while loop will only swap a total of ‘n’ numbers as once a number is at its correct index, we will move on to the next number. So overall, our algorithm will take O(n) + O(n) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(n).

### Space Complexity

The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
