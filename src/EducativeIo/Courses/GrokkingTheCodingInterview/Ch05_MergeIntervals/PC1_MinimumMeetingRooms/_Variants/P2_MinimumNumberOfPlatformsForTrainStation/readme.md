# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a list of intervals representing the arrival and departure times of trains to a train station, our goal is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the train station so that no train has to wait.

Example:

```plaintext
Input:
arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}

Output: 3
There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 11:00 to 11:20)
```
