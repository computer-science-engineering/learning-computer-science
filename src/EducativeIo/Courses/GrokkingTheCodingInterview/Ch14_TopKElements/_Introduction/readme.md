# Introduction

Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent ‘K’ elements among a given set falls under this pattern.

The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of ‘K’ elements is [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)). This pattern will make use of the Heap to solve multiple problems dealing with ‘K’ elements at a time from a set of given elements.
