# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an infinite sorted array (or an array with unknown size), find if a given number ‘key’ is present in the array. Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ if it is present in the array, otherwise return -1.

Since it is not possible to define an array with infinite (unknown) size, you will be provided with an interface `ArrayReader` to read elements of the array. ArrayReader.get(index) will return the number at index; if the array’s size is smaller than the index, it will return `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30], key = 16
Output: 6
Explanation: The key is present at index '6' in the array.
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30], key = 11
Output: -1
Explanation: The key is not present in the array.
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: [1, 3, 8, 10, 15], key = 15
Output: 4
Explanation: The key is present at index '4' in the array.
```

Example 4:

```plaintext
Input: [1, 3, 8, 10, 15], key = 200
Output: -1
Explanation: The key is not present in the array.
```
