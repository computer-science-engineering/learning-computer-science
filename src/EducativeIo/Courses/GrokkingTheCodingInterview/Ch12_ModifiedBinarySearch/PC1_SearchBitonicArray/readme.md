# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a Bitonic array, find if a given ‘key’ is present in it. An array is considered bitonic if it is monotonically increasing and then monotonically decreasing. Monotonically increasing or decreasing means that for any index `i` in the array `arr[i] != arr[i+1]`.

Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’. If the ‘key’ is not present, return -1.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [1, 3, 8, 4, 3], key=4
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [3, 8, 3, 1], key=8
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: [1, 3, 8, 12], key=12
Output: 3
```

Example 4:

```plaintext
Input: [10, 9, 8], key=10
Output: 0
```
