# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we can’t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called [Dutch National Flag problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem).

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]
```

## Notes

The brute force solution will be to use an in-place sorting algorithm like [Heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) which will take O(N*logN).

We can use a **Two Pointers** approach while iterating through the array. Let’s say the two pointers are called `low` and `high` which are pointing to the first and the last element of the array respectively. So while iterating, we will move all 0s before `low` and all 2s after `high` so that in the end, all 1s will be between `low` and `high`.

### Time complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we are iterating the input array only once.

### Space complexity

The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
