# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array `arr` of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target` where `i`, `j`, and `k` are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum is less than the target:
   [-1, 1, 4], [-1, 1, 3], [-1, 1, 2], [-1, 2, 3]
```

## Notes

This problem follows the **Two Pointers** pattern and shares similarities with **Triplet Sum to Zero**. The only difference is that, in this problem, we need to find the triplets whose sum is less than the given target. To meet the condition `i != j != k` we need to make sure that each number is not used more than once.

Following a similar approach, first we can sort the array and then iterate through it, taking one number at a time. Let’s say during our iteration we are at number ‘X’, so we need to find ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ such that `X + Y + Z < target`. At this stage, our problem translates into finding a pair whose sum is less than “target - X” (as from the above equation Y + Z == target - X). We can use a similar approach as discussed in **Triplet Sum to Zero**.

### Time complexity

Sorting the array will take O(N * logN). The `searchPair()` will take O(N). So, overall `searchTriplets()` will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).

### Space complexity

Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting if we are not using an in-place sorting algorithm.
