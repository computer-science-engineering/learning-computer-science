# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

**A height balanced BST:** a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**

```text
Given A : 1 -> 2 -> 3

A height balanced BST :

      2
    /   \
   1     3
```
