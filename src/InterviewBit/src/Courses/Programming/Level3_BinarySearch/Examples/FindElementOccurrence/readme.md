# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a sorted array of integers, find the number of occurrences of a given target value. Your algorithm’s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n). If the target is not found in the array, return 0

**Example:**

Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8, return 2.
