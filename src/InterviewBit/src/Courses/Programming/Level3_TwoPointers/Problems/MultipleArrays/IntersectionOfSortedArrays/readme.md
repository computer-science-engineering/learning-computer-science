# Problem Definition

## Description

Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.
OR in other words,
Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.

Example :

```plaintext
Input :
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 3 5]

Output : [3 3 5]

Input :
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 5]

Output : [3 5]
```

NOTE : For the purpose of this problem ( as also conveyed by the sample case ), assume that elements that appear more than once in both arrays should be included multiple times in the final output.
