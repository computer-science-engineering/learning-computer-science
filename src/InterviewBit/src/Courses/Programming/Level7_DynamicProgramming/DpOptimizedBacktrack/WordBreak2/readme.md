# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of words `dict`, add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word.

Return all such possible sentences.

For example, given

```text
s = "catsanddog",
dict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"].
```

A solution is

```text
[
  "cat sand dog",
  "cats and dog"
]
```

**Make sure the strings are sorted in your result.**
