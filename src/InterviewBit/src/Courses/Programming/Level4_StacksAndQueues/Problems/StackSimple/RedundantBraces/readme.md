# Problem Definition

## Description

Write a program to validate if the input string has redundant braces?
Return 0/1

```plaintext
0 -> NO
1 -> YES
```

Input will be always a valid expression

and operators allowed are only + , * , - , /

Example:

```plaintext
((a + b)) has redundant braces so answer will be 1
(a + (a + b)) doesn't have have any redundant braces so answer will be 0
```
