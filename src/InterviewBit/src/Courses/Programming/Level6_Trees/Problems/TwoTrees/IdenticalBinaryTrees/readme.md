## Description

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Return `0 / 1` ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input:

   1       1
  / \     / \
