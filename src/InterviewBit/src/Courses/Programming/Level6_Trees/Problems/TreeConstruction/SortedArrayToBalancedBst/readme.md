# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

Balanced tree: a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two sub-trees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

```plaintext
Given A: [1, 2, 3]
A height balanced BST:

      2
    /   \
   1     3
```
