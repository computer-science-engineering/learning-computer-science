# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a binary search tree, write a function to find the kth smallest element in the tree.

Example :

```plaintext
Input:
  2
 / \
1   3

and k = 2

Return : 2

As 2 is the second smallest element in the tree.
```

NOTE: You may assume `1 <= k <= Total number of nodes in BST`.
