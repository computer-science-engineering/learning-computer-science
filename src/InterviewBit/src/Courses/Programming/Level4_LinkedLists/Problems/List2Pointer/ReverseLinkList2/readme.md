# Problem Definition

## Description

Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in-place and in one-pass.

For example:

Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2 and n = 4,

return 1->4->3->2->5->NULL.

**Note:**

Given m, n satisfy the following condition: 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ length of list.

**Note 2:**

Usually the version often seen in the interviews is reversing the whole linked list which is obviously an easier version of this question.
