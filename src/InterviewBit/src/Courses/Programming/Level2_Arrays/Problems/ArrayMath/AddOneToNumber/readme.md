## Description

Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,

add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

Example:

If the vector has `[1, 2, 3]`

the returned vector should be `[1, 2, 4]`

as `123 + 1 = 124.`

Q : Can the input have 0’s before the most significant digit. Or in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?
A : For the purpose of this question, YES
Q : Can the output have 0’s before the most significant digit? Or in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?
A : For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.
