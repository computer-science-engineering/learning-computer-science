# Problem Definition

## Description

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

[An example](https://i.imgur.com/yaxpgda.png)

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens’ placement, where `Q` and `.` both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

For example,
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

```plaintext
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```
