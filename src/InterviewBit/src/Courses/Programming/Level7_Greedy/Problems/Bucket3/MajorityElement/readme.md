# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array of size `n`, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `floor(n/2)` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

**Example:**

```text
Input : [2, 1, 2]
Return : 2 which occurs 2 times which is greater than 3/2.
```
