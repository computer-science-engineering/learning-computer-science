# Problem Definition

## Description

There are `N` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station `i` is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station `i` to its next station `(i+1)`. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return `-1`.

You can only travel in one direction. `i to i+1, i+2, ... n-1, 0, 1, 2..`
Completing the circuit means starting at `i` and ending up at `i` again.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input:
      Gas :   [1, 2]
      Cost :  [2, 1]

Output: 1

If you start from index 0, you can fill in gas[0] = 1 amount of gas. Now your tank has 1 unit of gas. But you need cost[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1.
If you start from index 1, you can fill in gas[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your tank has 2 units of gas. You need cost[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So, you travel to station 0 and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in gas[0] = 1 unit of additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you cost[0] = 2 to get to station 1, which you do and complete the circuit.
```

## Notes

1. [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2286849/algorithm-for-truck-moving-around-a-circle-of-gas-stations)

    * if the total gas > cost, there must be a start index to finish the circle, else there isn't.
    * as to an index i, if from i, j is the first index that we cannot reach, then any index from i to j, cannot be the start index.

1. [LeetCode discussion - Share some of my ideas.](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/discuss/42568/Share-some-of-my-ideas.)

    The reason why I think this works:
    * if sum of gas is more than sum of cost, then there must be a solution. And the question guaranteed that the solution is unique(The first one I found is the right one).
    * The tank should never be negative, so restart whenever there is a negative number.
