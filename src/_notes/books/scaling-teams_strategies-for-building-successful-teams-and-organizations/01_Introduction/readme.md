## The Context for Growth

> In his book The Hard Thing About Hard Things (HarperBusiness), Ben Horowitz recalled that his company LoudCloud grew from 4 founders to 200 employees in less than 6 months, and then grew to 600 in less than a year!
>
> Such growth is an impressive achievement, but no matter how talented their leaders are, teams that grow by 300% in 12 months almost never see a 300% increase in the output of the team. Typically such rapid growth leads to diminishing returns.
>
> A rule of thumb derived from our experience and from conversations with leaders of hyper-growth companies is that once your development team is larger than 20, trying to double the team in less than a year is likely to lead to trouble. Expect to waste time on personnel issues, product flaws introduced by poorly trained new hires, flagging morale, and inefficient meetings instead of moving your product forward and keeping customers happy.
