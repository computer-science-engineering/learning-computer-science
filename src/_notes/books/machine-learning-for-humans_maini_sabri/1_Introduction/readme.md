# 1: Introduction

## Why machine learning matters

- Rapid advances in data storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent years.
- In 2015, Google trained a conversational agent (AI) that could not only convincingly interact with humans as a tech support helpdesk, but also discuss morality, express opinions, and answer general facts-based questions.
- The same year, DeepMind developed an agent that surpassed human-level performance at 49 Atari games, receiving only the pixels and game score as inputs. Soon after, in 2016, DeepMind obsoleted their own this achievement by releasing a new state-of-the-art gameplay method called A3C.
- AlphaGo defeated one of the best human players at Go. [Go 10^170 possible board positions (there are only 10^80 atoms in the universe).
- In March 2017, OpenAI created agents that invented their own language to cooperate and more effectively achieve their goal. Soon after, Facebook reportedly successfully training agents to negotiate and even lie.
- On August 11, 2017, OpenAI reached yet another incredible milestone by defeating the world’s top professionals in 1v1 matches of the online multiplayer game Dota 2.
- Today AI is used to design evidence-based treatment plans for cancer patients, instantly analyze results from medical tests to escalate to the appropriate specialist immediately, and conduct scientific research for drug discovery.
- Law enforcement uses visual recognition and natural language processing to process footage from body cameras.
- The Mars rover Curiosity even utilizes AI to autonomously select inspection-worthy soil and rock samples with high accuracy.

## The semantic tree: artificial intelligence and machine learning

- **Artificial intelligence is the study of agents that perceive the world around them, form plans, and make decisions to achieve their goals**. Its foundations include mathematics, logic, philosophy, probability, linguistics, neuroscience, and decision theory. Many fields fall under the umbrella of AI, such as computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing.
- **Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence**. Its goal is to enable computers to learn on their own. A machine’s learning algorithm enables it to identify patterns in observed data, build models that explain the world, and predict things without having explicit pre-programmed rules and models.

## The AI effect

- **Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)**: which can effectively perform a narrowly defined task.
- Human-level **artificial general intelligence (AGI)**, also known as strong AI. The definition of an AGI is an artificial intelligence that can successfully perform _any intellectual task that a human being can_, including learning, planning and decision-making under uncertainty, communicating in natural language, making jokes, manipulating people, trading stocks, or… reprogramming itself.
- If we create an AI that can improve itself, it would unlock a cycle of recursive self-improvement that could lead to an intelligence explosion over some unknown time period, ranging from many decades to a single day. ...this point referred to as the singularity.
- after we unlock AI’s ability to recursively improve itself, it’s impossible to predict what will happen, just as mice who intentionally designed a human might have trouble predicting what the human would do to their world.
- “researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years” (Grace et al, 2017).
- The advent of greater-than-human-level **artificial superintelligence (ASI)** could be one of the best or worst things to happen to our species. It carries with it the immense challenge of specifying what AIs will want in a way that is friendly to humans.
