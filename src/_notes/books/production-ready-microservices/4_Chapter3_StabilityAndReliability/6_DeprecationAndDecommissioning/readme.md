# Deprecation and Decommissioning

When a microservice is no longer in use or is no longer supported by a development team, its decommissioning should be undertaken carefully to ensure that no clients will be compromised.

The deprecation of one or more of a microserviceâ€™s API endpoints is even more common: when new features are added or old ones removed, the endpoints often change, requiring that client teams are updated and any requests made to the old endpoints are switched to new endpoints (or removed entirely).

When a microservice is about to be decommissioned, its development team needs to take care to alert all client services and advise them on how to accommodate the loss of their dependency. If the microservice being decommissioned is being replaced by another new microservice, or if the functionality of the microservice is being built into another existing microservice, then the team should help all clients update their microservices to send requests to the new endpoints.

Deprecation of an endpoint follows a similar process: the clients must be alerted, and either given the new endpoint or advised on how to account for the loss of the endpoint entirely. In both deprecation and decommissioning, monitoring plays a critical role: endpoints will need to be monitored closely before the service or endpoint is completely decommissioned and/or deprecated to check for any requests that might still be sent to the outdated service or endpoint.

Failing to properly deprecate an endpoint or decommission a microservice can also have disastrous effects on the microservice ecosystem.
