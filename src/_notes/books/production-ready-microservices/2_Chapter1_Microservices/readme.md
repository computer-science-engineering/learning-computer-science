# Chapter 1: Microservices

While the fundamental concepts behind microservices are not new,
the contemporary application of microservice architecture truly is, and its adoption has been driven in part by scalability challenges, lack of efficiency, slow developer velocity, and the
difficulties with adopting new technologies that arise when complex software systems are contained within and deployed as one large monolithic application.

With microservice architecture, an application can easily be scaled both horizontally and vertically, developer productivity and velocity increase dramatically, and old technologies can easily be swapped out for the newest ones.
