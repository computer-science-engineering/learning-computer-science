# Chapter 5. Fault Tolerance and Catastrophe-Preparedness

Ensuring availability across the microservice ecosystem requires careful failure planning, preparation for catastrophes, and actively pushing the microservice to fail in real time to ensure that it can recover from failures gracefully.

This chapter covers

* avoiding single points of failure,
* common catastrophes and failure scenarios,
* handling failure detection and remediation,
* implementing different types of resiliency testing, and 
* ways to handle incidents and outages at the organizational level when failures do occur.
