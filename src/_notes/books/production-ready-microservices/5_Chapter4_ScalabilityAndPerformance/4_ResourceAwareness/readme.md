# Resource Awareness

Before hardware resources can be efficiently allocated and distributed to microservices within the microservice ecosystem, it is important to identify the resource requirements and resource bottlenecks of each microservice. Resource requirements are the specific resources
(CPU, RAM, etc.) that each microservice needs; identifying these is essential for running a scalable service. Resource bottlenecks are the scalability and performance limitations of each individual microservice that are dependent on features of its resources.

## Resource Requirements

The resource requirements of a microservice are the hardware resources the microservice needs in order to run properly, to process tasks efficiently, and to be scaled vertically and/or horizontally.

The two most important and relevant hardware resources tend to be,
unsurprisingly, CPU and RAM (in multithreaded environments, threads become the important resource).

Determining the resource requirements of a microservice entails quantifying the CPU and RAM that one instance of the service needs in order to run. It is also important to keep an eye out for  resources that a microservice may need within the ecosystem. These can be hardware resources like database
connections or application platform resources like logging quotas.

The key here is to determine what the requirements are for only one instance of the service. The most effective and efficient way to scale our service is to scale it horizontally: if our traffic is about to increase, we want to add a few more hosts and deploy our service to those new hosts. In order for us to know how many hosts we need to add, we need to know what our service looks like running on only one host: how much traffic can it handle? how much CPU does it utilize? How much memory? Those numbers will tell us exactly what the resource requirements of our microservice are.

## Resource Bottlenecks

A resource bottleneck is anything inherent about the way the microservice utilizes its resources that limits the scalability of the application. This could be an infrastructure bottleneck or something within the architecture of the service that prevents it from being scalable. For example, the number of open database connections a microservice needs. Another example of a common resource bottleneck is when microservices need to be vertically scaled (rather than horizontally scaled, where more instances/hardware is added) when they experience an increase in traffic: if the only way to scale a microservice is to increase the resources of each instance (more CPU, more memory), then the two principles of scalability (concurrency and partitioning) are abandoned.

Some resource bottlenecks are easy to identify. If your microservice can only be scaled to meet growing traffic by deploying it to machines with more CPU and memory, then you have a scalability bottleneck and need to refactor the microservice so that it can be scaled horizontally rather than vertically, using concurrency and partitioning as your guiding principles.

Vertical scaling isnâ€™t a sustainable or scalable way to architect microservices. It may appear to work out all right in situations where each microservice has dedicated hardware, but it will not work well with the new hardware abstraction and isolation technologies that are used in the tech world today, like Docker and Apache Mesos. Always optimize for concurrency and partitioning if you want to build a scalable application.

Best way to discover resource bottlenecks that may not be obvious is to run extensive load testing on the service.
