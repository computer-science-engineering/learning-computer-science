# Preface

stable, reliable, scalable, fault tolerant, performant, monitored, documented, and prepared for any catastrophe.

## Who This Book Is Written For

Software engineers and site reliability engineers who have
either split a monolith and are wondering “what’s next?”, or who are building microservices from the ground up and want to design stable, reliable, scalable, fault-tolerant, performant
microservices from the get-go.

## What This Book Is Not

This book is not a step-by-step how-to guide. It is a highly abstract book.

...introduce concepts, explain their importance to building production-ready microservices, offer examples of each concept, and share strategies for their implementation.

...not a description of the Uber engineering organization.

...not a descriptive or historical account,
but a prescriptive guide to building production-ready microservices.

## How To Use This Book

...read only the chapters you are interested in.

... skim through the book, reading carefully the sections that are relevant to your needs, and then apply some of the principles and standards to your microservice(s).

...each chapter should be read carefully, each standard understood, and each requirement adjusted and applied to fit the needs of your
microservice(s).

## How This Book Is Structured

Chapter 1, Microservices, is an introduction to microservices.

Chapter 2, Production-Readiness, the challenges of microservice standardization are presented, and the eight production-readiness standards, all driven by microservice availability, are introduced.

Chapter 3, Stability and Reliability, is all about the principles of building stable and reliable microservices.

Chapter 4, Scalability and Performance, narrows in on the requirements for building scalable and performant microservices.

Chapter 5, Fault Tolerance and Catastrophe-Preparedness, covers the principles of building fault-tolerant microservices that are prepared for any catastrophe.

Chapter 6, Monitoring, is all about the nitty-gritty details of microservice monitoring and how to avoid the complexities of microservice monitoring through standardization.

Chapter 7, Documentation and Understanding, which dives into
appropriate microservice documentation and ways to increase architectural and operational understanding...

Appendix A, Production-Readiness Checklist, is the checklist described at the end of Chapter 7, Documentation and Understanding, and is a concise summary of all the production-readiness standards that are scattered throughout the book, along with their corresponding requirements.

Appendix B, Evaluate Your Microservice, is a collection of all the “Evaluate Your Microservice” questions found in the corresponding sections at the end of Chapters 3-7.
