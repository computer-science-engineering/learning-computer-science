# The Challenges of Microservice Standardization

The adoption of microservice architecture brings a considerable amount of freedom to developers.

Each microservice is part of a microservice ecosystem, and complex dependency chains are a necessary inevitability.

If the overall system or product is to be any good, it must be held to certain standards, and consequently, each of its parts must abide by these standards as well.

We must define standards and requirements for our microservices, and they must be general enough to apply to every single microservice yet specific enough to be quantifiable and produce measurable results. This is where the concept of production-readiness comes in.
