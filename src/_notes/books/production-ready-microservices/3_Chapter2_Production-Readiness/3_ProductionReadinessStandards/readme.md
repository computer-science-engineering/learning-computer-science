# Production-Readiness Standards

The basic idea behind production-readiness is this: a production-ready application or service is one that can be trusted to serve production traffic.

Production-readiness is the key to microservice standardization, the key to achieving availability across the microservice ecosystem.

We need to know exactly what requirements every service must meet in order to be deemed production-ready. The requirements must themselves be principles that are true for every microservice, for every application, and for every distributed system: standardization without principle is meaningless.

It turns out that there is a set of eight principles that, when adopted together, fits these criteria. Each of these principles is quantifiable, gives rise to a set of actionable requirements, and produces measurable results. They are:

1. stability,
2. reliability,
3. scalability,
4. fault tolerance,
5. catastrophe-preparedness,
6. performance,
7. monitoring,
8. documentation.

The driving force behind each of these principles is that, together, they contribute to and drive the availability of a microservice.
