# Implementing Production-Readiness

The power of these production-readiness standards and the requirements they impose lies in their remarkable applicability and strict granularity: they are both general enough to apply to any ecosystem, yet specific enough to provide concrete strategies for implementation.

Standardization requires buy-in from all levels of the organization, and must be adopted and driven both from the top-down and from the bottom-up.

Standardization brings freedom and reduces entropy.

Once the engineering organization has adopted and agreed to follow production-readiness standards, the next step is to evaluate and elaborate on each standardâ€™s requirements.

Typically the implementation and enforcement of the production-readiness standards is driven by the site reliability engineering (SRE) organizations. Typically, SREs are
responsible for the availability of the services, and so driving these standards across the microservice ecosystem fits in quite well with existing responsibilities.
