## Description

A palindrome is a string or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "madam" is a palindrome. Write a method that takes in a String and returns a boolean -> true if the input String is a palindrome and false if it is not. An empty string and a null input are considered palindromes. You also need to account for the space character. For example, "race car" should return false as read backward it is "rac ecar".

Examples:

```plaintext
isStringPalindrome("madam") -> true
isStringPalindrome("aabb") -> false
isStringPalindrome("race car") -> false
isStringPalindrome("") -> true
isStringPalindrome(null) -> true
```
