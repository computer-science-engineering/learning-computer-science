Different ways to build and run a stable and reliable microservice are explored, including

* standardizing the development process,
* building comprehensive deployment pipelines,
* understanding dependencies and protecting against their failures,
* building stable and reliable routing and discovery, and
* establishing appropriate deprecation and decommissioning procedures for old or outdated microservices and/or their endpoints.
