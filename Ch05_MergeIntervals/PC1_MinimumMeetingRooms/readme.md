# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, find the **minimum number of rooms** required to **hold all the meetings**.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Meetings: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings. [7,9] can
occur in any of the two rooms later.
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Meetings: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the meetings overlap, therefore we only need one room to hold all meetings.
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Meetings: [[1,4], [2,3], [3,6]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since [1,4] overlaps with the other two meetings [2,3] and [3,6], we need two rooms to
hold all the meetings.
```

​
Example 4:

```plaintext
Meetings: [[4,5], [2,3], [2,4], [3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We will need one room for [2,3] and [3,5], and another room for [2,4] and [4,5].
```

## Notes

Let’s take the above-mentioned example (4) and try to follow our **Merge Intervals** approach:

**Meetings:** [[4,5], [2,3], [2,4], [3,5]]

**Step 1:** Sorting these meetings on their start time will give us: [[2,3], [2,4], [3,5], [4,5]]

**Step 2:** Merging overlapping meetings:

- [2,3] overlaps with [2,4], so after merging we’ll have => [[2,4], [3,5], [4,5]]
- [2,4] overlaps with [3,5], so after merging we’ll have => [[2,5], [4,5]]
- [2,5] overlaps [4,5], so after merging we’ll have => [2,5]

Since all the given meetings have merged into one big meeting ([2,5]), does this mean that they all are overlapping and we need a minimum of four rooms to hold these meetings? You might have already guessed that the answer is NO! As we can clearly see, some meetings are mutually exclusive. For example, [2,3] and [3,5] do not overlap and can happen in one room. So, to correctly solve our problem, we need to keep track of the mutual exclusiveness of the overlapping meetings.

Here is what our strategy will look like:

1. We will sort the meetings based on start time.
2. We will schedule the first meeting (let’s call it `m1`) in one room (let’s call it `r1`).
3. If the next meeting `m2` is not overlapping with `m1`, we can safely schedule it in the same room `r1`.
4. If the next meeting `m3` is overlapping with `m2` we can’t use `r1`, so we will schedule it in another room (let’s call it `r2`).
5. Now if the next meeting `m4` is overlapping with `m3`, we need to see if the room `r1` has become free. For this, we need to keep track of the end time of the meeting happening in it. If the end time of `m2` is before the start time of `m4`, we can use that room `r1`, otherwise, we need to schedule `m4` in another room `r3`.

We can conclude that we need to **keep track of the ending time of all the meetings currently happening** so that when we try to schedule a new meeting, we can see what meetings have already ended. We need to put this information in a data structure that can easily give us the smallest ending time. A **Min Heap** would fit our requirements best.

So our algorithm will look like this:

1. Sort all the meetings on their start time.
2. Create a min-heap to store all the active meetings. This min-heap will also be used to find the active meeting with the smallest end time.
3. Iterate through all the meetings one by one to add them in the min-heap. Let’s say we are trying to schedule the meeting `m1`.
4. Since the min-heap contains all the active meetings, so before scheduling `m1` we can remove all meetings from the heap that have ended before `m1`, i.e., remove all meetings from the heap that have an end time smaller than or equal to the start time of `m1`.
5. Now add `m1` to the heap.
6. The heap will always have all the overlapping meetings, so we will need rooms for all of them. Keep a counter to remember the maximum size of the heap at any time which will be the minimum number of rooms needed.

### Time complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N \* logN), where ‘N’ is the total number of meetings. This is due to the sorting that we did in the beginning. Also, while iterating the meetings we might need to poll/offer meeting to the priority queue. Each of these operations can take O(logN). Overall our algorithm will take O(N \* logN).

### Space complexity

The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting. Also, in the worst case scenario, we’ll have to insert all the meetings into the Min Heap (when all meetings overlap) which will also take O(N) space. The overall space complexity of our algorithm is O(N).
