# Chapter 4. Scalability and Performance

A scalable, performant microservice is one that is driven by efficiency, one that can not only handle a large number of tasks or requests at the same time, but can handle them efficiently and is prepared for tasks or requests to increase in the future.

The essential components of microservice scalability and performance include

* understanding the qualitative and quantitative growth scales,
* hardware efficiency,
* identification of resource requirements and bottlenecks,
* capacity awareness and planning,
* scalable handling of traffic,
* the scaling of dependencies,
* task handling and processing, and
* scalable data storage.
