## Description

Given an m x n matrix of 0s and 1s, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.

Do it in place.

Example

Given array A as

1 0 1
1 1 1
1 1 1

On returning, the array A should be :

0 0 0
1 0 1
1 0 1

Note that this will be evaluated on the extra memory used. Try to minimize the space and time complexity.
