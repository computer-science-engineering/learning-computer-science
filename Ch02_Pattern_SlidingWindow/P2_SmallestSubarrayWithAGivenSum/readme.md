# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number 'S', find the length of the **smallest subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to 'S'**. Return 0, if no such subarray exists.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum great than or equal to '7' is [5, 2].
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S=7
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [8].
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: [3, 4, 1, 1, 6], S=8
Output: 3
Explanation: Smallest subarrays with a sum greater than or equal to '8' are [3, 4, 1] or [1, 1, 6].
```

## Notes

For Sliding Window algorithm:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N). The outer for loop runs for all elements and the inner while loop processes each element only once, therefore the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
