# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a string and a pattern, find **all anagrams of the pattern in the given string**.

**Anagram** is actually a **Permutation** of a string. For example, “abc” has the following six anagrams:

1. abc
2. acb
3. bac
4. bca
5. cab
6. cba

Write a function to return a list of starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: String="ppqp", Pattern="pq"
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The two anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "pq" and "qp".
```

Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: String="abbcabc", Pattern="abc"
Output: [2, 3, 4]
Explanation: The three anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "bca", "cab", and "abc".
```

## Notes

This problem follows the **Sliding Window** pattern and is very similar to **Permutation in a String**. In this problem, we need to find every occurrence of any permutation of the pattern in the string. We will use a list to store the starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the string.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N + M) where ‘N’ and ‘M’ are the number of characters in the input string and the pattern respectively.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(M) since in the worst case, the whole pattern can have distinct characters which will go into the **HashMap**. In the worst case, we also need O(N) space for the result list, this will happen when the pattern has only one character and the string contains only that character.
